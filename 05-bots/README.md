## Bot Project, Due Friday, October 20

Create a bot! For the purposes of this class, I'm defining a bot as "a computer program which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods." This can be applied very broadly, that conversation can be one-sided, two-sided, multi-sided, and it's optional whether there are humans involved at all! You may choose any platform for the course. Examples are provided above for [Discord](https://discord.com/) and TBD but you are welcome to experiment with any social media platform, service, conversational interface, hardware, website, sms system, etc. as you see fit!

Document the process of creating your bot and running your bot in a blog post. Include sample interactions / posts from your bot with screenshots,etc. Reflect on the [Bot Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Programming-from-A-to-Z/Bot-Code-of-Conduct/blob/main/README.md) and what ethical questions you considered as part of your process and documentation.

Prepare a 5 minute presentation on your bot on Friday, Oct 20th.
